# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health metrics using machine learning techniques. By leveraging supervised learning algorithms, the model helps identify potential diabetes cases for early intervention and medical support.

## Project Overview
Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions worldwide. Early detection can significantly improve management and outcomes. This project utilizes historical data, such as glucose levels, BMI, and age, to build a predictive model that identifies individuals at risk of developing diabetes.

## Features of the Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:

- **Pregnancies**: Number of times the individual has been pregnant.
- **Glucose**: Blood glucose concentration.
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
- **Insulin**: Serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Family history of diabetes.
- **Age**: Age of the individual.
- **Outcome**: Target variable (1: Diabetes, 0: No Diabetes).

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas (Data manipulation and analysis)
  - NumPy (Numerical computing)
  - Scikit-learn (Machine learning)
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn (Data visualization)
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

## Model Development Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Normalize/scale the features.
   - Split data into training and testing sets.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze correlations between features.
   - Visualize feature distributions.

3. **Model Selection and Training**:
   - Experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
   - Use cross-validation to evaluate model performance.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision

## Future Improvements

- Incorporate additional features like lifestyle habits and medical history.
- Experiment with advanced models like Neural Networks.
- Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI for real-time predictions.
